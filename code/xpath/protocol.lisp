;;;; We represent nodes and relations for which the "un-build"
;;;; protocol is available as XML nodes and evaluate XPath expressions
;;;; on them.
;;;;
;;;; Technically, the XML nodes are proxies representing the actual
;;;; nodes and relations (see proxies.lisp):
;;;;
;;;; * nodes are mapped to XML element nodes with namespace URI and
;;;;   local-name determined by the value of `node-kind'.
;;;;
;;;; * node initargs are mapped to XML attribute nodes with namespace
;;;;   URI and local-name determined by the symbol naming the initarg.
;;;;
;;;; * relations are mapped to (entirely synthetic) XML element nodes
;;;;   with namespace URI and local-name determined by the symbol
;;;;   naming the relation.
;;;;
;;;; * relation arguments are mapped to XML attribute nodes with
;;;;   namespace URI and local-name determined by the symbol naming
;;;;   the initarg.
;;;;
;;;; In summary, a node tree of the form
;;;;
;;;;   (node* (+ :foo 1 'cl-user::bar 2)
;;;;     (1 :baz (node* (:fez))))
;;;;
;;;; roughly corresponds to an XML node tree of the form
;;;;
;;;;   <cl:+ xmlns:cl="common-lisp"
;;;;         xmlns:cu="common-lisp-user"
;;;;         foo="1" cu:bar="2">
;;;;     <baz>
;;;;       <fez/>
;;;;     </baz>

   "Evaluate XPATH on TREE using BUILDER in the XPath adapter.

    XPATH can be any XPath object accepted by `xpath:evaluate',
    i.e. an XPath expression string or a compiled representation.

    BUILDER has to provide the \"un-build\" protocol for all nodes in
    TREE.

    PRINTERS, when supplied, has to be a list of elements of the form

      (PREDICATE . PRINTER)

    where PREDICATE is a function that, when called with a value as
    the sole argument, returns a Boolean indicating whether PRINTER
    should be used to render the value as a string. The lambda-list of
    PRINTER must be compatible to

      (BUILDER VALUE)

    where BUILDER is the builder stored in NAVIGATOR and VALUE is a
    value extracted from THING such as the value of a valued proxy
    node. The function must return a string representation of
    VALUE.

    PEEK-FUNCTION behaves like the corresponding keyword parameter of
    `architecture.builder-protocol:walk-nodes'.

    NODE-ORDER only has an effect if XPATH evaluates to a node set. In
    that case, NODE-ORDER controls whether/how the returned node set
    is ordered. Possible values are:

    NIL

      The returned node set can be arranged in any order. This can be
      significantly faster than establishing a particular order.

    :document-order

      Nodes appear in the returned node set in document order."))
